        <p class="lead">Welcome to my awesome webpage. I am a current student a CSULB. I am struggling to find my passion but I am staying positive. I feel bad that I never had a "dream" of what I wanted to be. I couldn't imagine myself as anything but maybe college will help guide me! College so far is scary and lonely. I hope the pandemic starts winding down and we can go in-person! I really want to meet more amazing people and kindly force them to be my friend.  I have been here on this planet for 18+ years. More about me is that I have a younger sister named Kaley. She is taller than me and I think that is completely unfair. I drank milk and everything, so I am wondering what went wrong. I love cats too and I am jealous of anyone who has one. My parents are weird people and hate animals. This means that I will probably won't get a pet until I can move out and have some sort of income. Other than that, my parents are chill people. They like to sleep and eat like most people. I also live my grandma. I recently helped her installed games on her phone that she can played since she gets bored from time to time. She is suddenly becoming a gamer and I am not mad about it. I fully support her small gaming addiction. My favorite thing to do is waste my time on the internet by reading webtoons or watching food vlogs. I have been craving bimbap and ramen. They are both one of my favorite foods to make because they are so easy and delicious. Justin Bieber definitely wrote "Yummy" after those two. I am excited for the semester to come to a close since I can finally sleep to my wildest dreams and binge more shows to rant to my three friends about. I hopefully can videochat with my dear friends soon too since they probably miss me a lot. This is all I have for today! I wish this wasn't too boring or weird. 

If you read this far, I hope you drank water and didn't step on a green lego. </p>
